efficient_bot
1. simple form of a single bot with simplist form with optimal implementation (in terms of maps extraction, moving). Order excecution should be manualy writen. **basic execution testing**
**create consistent test and running tools/api for bot**
2. a single bot should be able to fullfill an order successfully without manual instruction. (Need order to task convertion.) **order reasoning**
3. Two bots should be able to fullfill an order successfully. (optimal task delegation given all the information.) **multi bot cooridination** There are at most 2 bots
4. able to fullfill all order ([a,b]) optimally. (combine tasks and sort based on priority)
5. sort the order and balance what orders should be take (no waste before)

sabotage_bot
1. throw away anything in the box, in the pot, in the plate.
2. Let the opponent pick up something else/ block their way in bfs
2. block their submition block (hard)



edge case:
the map is filled with robots, cannot move
